# BrewsNDadJokes #
Austin's first and only brewery search website that keeps you laughing while your searching for your favorite craft libation!

## User Story ##

Austin beer enthusiasts need a place to identify the geographical location of their favorite/untried breweries. They can browse using a list of breweries by zip code that is available in the sidebar, or via the "Search by Zip" function. Once a brewery-of-interest has been identified, users will be able to pinpoint that brewery with a map query. 

The final, and funniest, function of BrewsNDadJokes is the "Generate Joke" button located in the top right-hand side of the page. One click and you will be served with a fresh, delectable 'Dad Joke'.
